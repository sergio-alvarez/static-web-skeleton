# Static Web Skeleton

## What is this?

This project proposes a basic skeleton for starting an **static-website's development** by using the [Gumby Framework](http://gumbyframework.com/) as well as other usual front-end libraries (such as Bower or Grunt).

## What it offers to me?

By using this basic setup, you can easily start writing some HTML and Sass for getting the first results.

* Thinking about **internationalization**? One of the best libraries for internationalize your site in the Client's layer is bundled (with Bower): [i18next](http://i18next.com/).
* What about the EU Cookie's Law? You have [cookiecuttr.js](http://cookiecuttr.com/) located at `site/javascripts/libs/vendor/` for notifying your users about your required cookies.

Still thinking about using PHP for your lightweight website? :)

## TODO

* I'm still thinking about the best way for uglifying my JavaScripts files without making my debugging process annoying.
* It would be useful to add some kind of template's system for reusing HTML snippets (Handlebars?).
